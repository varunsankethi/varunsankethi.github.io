        Turīya is not that which is conscious of the internal (subjective)
        world, nor that which is conscious of the external (objective) world,
        nor that which is conscious of both, nor that which is a mass all
        sentiency, nor that which is simple consciousness, nor that which is
        insentient. (It is) unseen (by any sense organ), not related to
        anything, incomprehensible (by the mind), uninferable, unthinkable,
        indescribable, essentially of the nature of Consciousness constituting
        the Self alone, negation of all phenomena, the Peaceful, all Bliss and
        the Non-dual. This is what is known as the fourth (Turīya). This is the
        Ātman and it has to be realised.
